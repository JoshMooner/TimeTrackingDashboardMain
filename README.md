## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design with media query
- JSON and Fetch
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to use the Fetch API and how to access to the elements of a JSON file. I practice CSS Grid, responsive design with media query and other properties. I also learned how to manage many event listeners on the same program


### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on learning on how to improve the structure of my code and made him more optimal. Also I want to learn how to use anothers API

### Useful resources

- [Fetch Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-j5SI7Qitk) - This helped me because it's a simple tutorial of how to use the API fetch and also helped to develop the logic to solve the challenge.
